Two guys with no ML knowledge set out to create a Neural Network to do Twitter sentiment analysis. :D

How to use:

1. Extract Sentiment Analysis Dataset to "full_data" (or whatever you want)

2. Run 'python3 split_data.py full_data 1000' to split the training data into a random set of 1000 bad tweets and 1000 good tweets.

3. Run 'python3 ffn_twitter.py'. Currently you must hardcode the file names.
